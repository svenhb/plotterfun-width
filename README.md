# Plotterfun 'pen-width'

Modificated scripts from the original plotterfun: https://github.com/mitxela/plotterfun

Instead of drawing squiggles, the pen width will be modified. 

In GRBL-Plotter the pen-width can be translated to a Z or S value to change the hight / contact pressure of a paint brush, using the z-axis or a RC-Servo.
